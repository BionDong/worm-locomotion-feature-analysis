# worm-locomotion-feature-analysis

This project was developed for the realtime analysis of C. elegans morphologic features of length/width/volume/curvature during free moving on agar substrate. Based on the analysis results, the worm body was divided into 100~200 segments on both dorsal and ventral side. The overall time cost of a single image frame takes less than 2 ms.
